// As in JavaScript, all numbers in TypeScript are floating point values. These floating point numbers get the type number. In addition to hexadecimal and decimal literals, TypeScript also supports binary and octal literals introduced in ECMAScript 2015.

const decimal: number = 6;
const hex: number = 0xf00d;
const binary: number = 0b1010;
const octal: number = 0o744;
